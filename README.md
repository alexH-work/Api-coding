# Api-coding

This code is from my first attempt at learning how to make and implement REST API's. I made a two different GET APIs. One will get all users within the database, while the other will get a specific user based on the ID passed in. I have a POST API that will be used to create new users within the database. A DELETE API to remove a user based on the ID passed in. Finally a PATCH API to have a way to edit previous user data. I used a PATCH over PUT so that only the necessary data needing to be changed will be replaced rather than overwrite all the data.
