# Api-coding

This code is from my first attempt at learning how to make and implement REST API's. 
 ### GET ###
- There are two different GET APIs.
  - One gets the dara of all users within the database
  - The other will get a specific user's data based on the ID passed in. 
 ### POST ###
- There is a POST API that will be used to create new users within the database. 
 ### DELETE ###
- A DELETE API to remove a user based on the ID passed in.
 ### PATCH ###
- A PATCH API to have a way to edit previous user data. 
- I used a PATCH over PUT so that only the necessary data needing to be changed will be replaced rather than overwrite all the data.
